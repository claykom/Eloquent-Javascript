# Eloquent JavaScript Exercises
This repository is the home to all of my solutions to [*Eloquent JavaScript* by Marijn Haverbeke's](https://eloquentjavascript.net/). I have previous programming experience but am learning more about JavaScript so this book has been a great resource to familiarize myself with the language and it's syntax.

## On Hold
I've been working on a lot on Golang projects so this is on hold for the time being. As I need javascript I'll come back to this.

## Goals
 - I hope to complete the book and develop a good understanding of the language so I can start to work on some projects.
 - After I complete this book and have the knowledge I will do some of the previous years Advent of Code challenges as well.
